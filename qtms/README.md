# Quantum Time Messaging System

A quantum experiment modeling system with delayed choice for transmitting information "back in time". The project demonstrates a conceptual model where each bit of information is encoded as a separate quantum experiment.

## Concept

The system is based on the quantum delayed choice experiment (Wheeler's delayed choice experiment), which demonstrates that the choice of how to measure a quantum system can affect its past state. In our model:

1. Each bit of information is encoded as a separate quantum experiment
2. One type of measurement is chosen for bit "0", another for bit "1"
3. Hidden parameters ensure predictability and stability of transmission
4. Temporal correlation and quantum entanglement in time are used to model information transmission "back in time"

## Installation and Launch

### Requirements

- Node.js (version 14.0.0 or higher)
- npm (version 6.0.0 or higher)

### Launch

1. Start the server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

2. Open in browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Usage

1. **Sending a Message**:
   - Enter text in the input field
   - Click "Send Message"
   - Observe the quantum transmission process

2. **Parameter Settings**:
   - Use presets for quick configuration
   - Or adjust individual parameters manually using sliders
   - Click "Update Parameters" to apply changes

3. **Results Analysis**:
   - The "Bits" tab shows encoding details
   - The "Log" tab contains transmission history
   - The "Analysis" tab offers optimization recommendations

## Hidden Parameters

The system uses the following hidden parameters to model quantum effects:

- **Predetermination Factor** - affects the predictability of quantum measurement results
- **Temporal Correlation** - links future measurements with past states
- **Time Entanglement** - extends quantum entanglement concept to the time axis
- **Consistency Parameter** - ensures result stability
- **Redundancy Factor** - determines redundancy level for error correction

## Parameter Presets

- **Balanced** - optimal balance between accuracy and speed
- **High Accuracy** - maximum transmission accuracy, but slower
- **High Speed** - fast transmission, but with possible errors
- **Experimental** - extreme values for exploring model boundaries

## Limitations

This system is a conceptual model and demonstration, not a real quantum device:

1. It does not claim to actually transmit information back in time
2. Hidden parameters are used as a conceptual tool
3. Real quantum processes are simplified for clarity
